version history:

0.0.2:
fixed a bug with ship name, ship can tell if it is sunk or not.

0.0.1:
initialized creation of files, added ship class

aug 4: 130 pm
created filed for battleship ai program
the purpose of this program is to design a feed-forward neural network that will hopefully play better than the algorirthm played here

http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/

whose median game length is 42 shots over 10 million games.

I want to explore these avenues
1) How well does an artificial intelligence play with just the probability density function as implemented by datagenetics?
2) how well does an artificial intelligence play with probability function as input and using weights to determine where to place the shot
3) How well does an artifical intelligence learn if the inputs of the board are all at 1 (or a similar value?) Will it eventually converge on the probability density function?
4) Can the artificial intelligence look ahead to determine the best possible location in the hopes of finding a ship faster? Implement this for functionalities 1 2 and 3 above.

worked on this for about 45 minutes.
so far, have a map to ships by their type. still need to figure out how to get the name in there also, if it is necessary.
